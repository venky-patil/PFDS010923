Variable --> Variables are used to store a value.
         --> Variable is something which is going to hold the memory location of any data.


Example:

x = "Praty1234a$%^&*"  #Here x is a variable and Pratyush is my Data which is stored in x variable.

print(x+"Srivastava")

x = 10
print("x") #x

x = 10
print(x) #10


Types of Programming Languages:

1.Static Typed Programming Language --> Static Typed  Programming language are those languages in which we 					need to define or declare the type of data that we are using in our 					program.
                                    --> In Static programming we need to specify the datatype first before 					execution.

Example of Static Typed Programming Language --> C/C++ AND JAVA

In C:

Adding Two Numbers

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
int main()
{
        int a=10;
        int b=20;
        int c=a+b;
        printf("Sum is %d",&c)
}


2.Dynamic Typed Programming Languages --> Dynamic Typed Programming languages  are those language in which we 					  need not to define the datatype. At the Runtime Compiler will 					  automatically analyze the datatype.

Example of Dynamic Typed Programming Language --> Python and JavaScript

In Python:

Adding Two Numbers in Python:

a=10
b=20
c=a+b
print(c)


DataTypes --> Data+Types 
          --> Represent which kind of Data we are using in our Program.

Example:


Phone_Number --> Integer
Name         --> String
Quantity     --> Float


Note --> Python is a Dynamic Typed Programming Language that means We need not to mention
         which kind of Data we are using in our Program.Internally PVM will automatically
         Determine which kind of Datatype we are using in our Program.

PVM --> Python Virtual Machine


type()  --> This Functions will return the dataype which we are using in our Program


n=10
print(type(10)) #integer

n="Ansh"
print(type(n)) #String


Types of Data Types:

1.Numeric Datatypes --> int,float,complex
2.Sequence Datatype --> list,string,tuples
3.Boolean Datatype  --> True , False
4.Dictionary
5.Set


Numeric Datatype
=================

Integer Datatype --> Represent the Integral values.

Types of Integer Datatype:

Postive Integers  --> 0,1,2,3,4,5.....Infinite
Negative Integers --> -1,-2,-3,-4.....-Infinite

Note --> If we want to represent a datatype without decimal then we are going to
use integer datatype.


#Example of Integer Datatype

num = 1098
print(type(num)) #int


num = -98
print(type(num)) #int 


num =  0
print(type(num)) #int


Note --> In Other Programming Languages and Even in python 2.x version we are having
         long datatype for handling large integer values But In python 3.x version
         we don't have any long datatype and all the large integer values are going
         to be handled by integer datatype.

num = 9876543219
print(type(num)) #int


num = 1234567890123456789123456789123456789123456789
print(type(num)) #int 

Float Datatype --> Represents floating point numbers(Decimal Numbers)

Two Types of Floating Numbers are There:

1.Positive Floating point Numbers --> 1.1,1.2,12.3.......
2.Negative Floating Point Numbers --> -0.1,-0.2.....

Note --> If we want to represent any number with decimal then we are going
to use float datatype.


#Example of Float Datatypes:

num = 1.2
print(type(num)) #float

num = 0.0
print(type(num)) #float

num = -0.02313
print(type(num)) #float


num = -0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
print(type(num)) #float


Complex Datatype --> Any Number is in the form of 

                a+bj

                is known as Complex Number

a is Real Part of the Number

b is Imaginary Part of the Number

j^2  Value is -1

j Value is -1^(1/2)


#Example of Complex Number

#a+bj  -->  a is real part and b is imaginary part 

num = 10+30j
print(type(num)) #complex



num = 10.0+30j
print(type(num)) #Complex


num = 30j
print(type(num)) #Complex


Note --> For Getting Real part Value We are having a variable which is real.This variable 
         will always return the result in the form of floating pointing number.

     --> For Getting the Value of Imaginary part we are having a variable which is imag.
         This variable will always return the result in the form of floating pointing 
         number.

#Example of Complex Number with imag and real variables.

num = 1+2j
print(num.imag) #2.0


num = 2j
print(num.real) #0.0

num = 30+55.9j 
print(num.imag)  #55.9

num = 10+20j
print(num.real) #10.0

num = 33.5j  
print(num.real) #0.0


num = 10-2j  
print(num.real) #10.0

num = 10-2j  
print(num.imag) #-2.0


num = 10j
print(num) #10j


num1 = 10+20j
num2 = 1+2j
print(num1+num2) #11+22j

num1 = 10+20j
num2 = 1+2j
print(num1-num2) #9-18j


num1 = 10+20j
num2 = 1+2j
print(num1*num2) #-30+40j

(10+20j)(1+2j)
10+20j+20j+40j^2
10+40j-40
-30+40j

Note --> In real Time we are not using Complex Numbers
     --> Complex numbers are used for computational or scientific programming that
         is a reason ISRO DRDO and NASA are Using Python as a Core Programming Language.
         As Other Programming Language don't have anything related to complex Datatype
         and In python we can do many operations of complex datatype very easily.



Boolean Datatype --> Boolean Simply Means True or False.
                 --> In Python True Means 1 and False Means 0



# Example of Boolean Datatype

num1 = True
print(type(num1)) #Bool

num2 = False
print(type(num2))


num2 = True+False+True+False+True+True+True
#       1  +  0  +  1 +  0  +  1 +  1 + 1
print(num2) #5

num1  = True+50.0
#        1  +50.0
print(num1) #51.0


String Datatype --> String is the sequence or a collection of Characters.
                --> If you are writing any thing within single quotes or double quotes 
                    or triple quotes then that datatype will always be considered as
                    a String Datatype.

                --> In Python we Don't have Char Datatype whereas In Other Programming
                    Languages we are having Char Datatype.

                --> In Python If you are Taking one character either in Single quotes
                    or in Double Quotes then that is also being considered as a
                    String in Python.

Note --> Characters means Any Symbol which is present in your Keyword.
     
     --> If are Storing a Single Character in Single Quotes then in other Programming
         Language that datatype is going to be Considered as a Char Datatype.
    
     --> In Python we can use any type quotation there is no any difference in
         single quotes,double quotes or triple quotes.


Example of Char Datatype(Single Character within Single Quotes):

num = '9'  #Char Datatype



string1 = 'a'
print(type(string1)) #String

string1 = "10+20j"
print(type(string1)) #String

string1 ='''True'''
print(type(string1)) #String 


string1 ="Hi How are You I Hope Your Python Classes are Going Well"
print(type(string1))#String


x = "10.5"
print(type(x))#String

date = "08-08-2023"
print(type(x))#String


num1 = '9'
print(type(num1)) #String

num1 = "9"
print(type(num1)) #String
