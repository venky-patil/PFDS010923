Conditional Statements --> Conditional Statements are totally based on Condition.If the 
given Condition is True Then i want to execute a set of statements(Block) and if the Condition
is false then i need to execute another set of statements(Block) that is nothing
but conditional statements in Python.

Example:
Day = Saturday
if (Tomorrow is Sunday) --> I will go to play Cricket else I will go to College.

if (India will Win) --> Then India will play vs Srilanka in World Cup Final else India 
will knocked out from the tournament.

if(Tomorrow is Rainy)  --> Then i will eat chai Pakoda else I will eat Dosa.

In Python Conditional Statements are Totally based on if ,elif, and else keyword.

Block of Code --> If we are writing a set of Instructions(Code) then that is nothing but a block.  
=============

Example --> Conditional_Statements,Functions,Loops,Object Oriented Programming,Exception Handling.

Indentation--> Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where 
in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, 
the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate 
a block of code.


Variations of Conditional Statements:

1. if --> If we have a single Condition 
2. if else --> if we have two Conditions 
3. if elif else  --> If we are having multiple conditions.
4. Nested if elif else --> Condition inside Condition


if Statements+
================

Syntax:

if condition:
    statement-1
    statement-2
    statement-3
    statement-4
statement-5

#Example of if statement:

student_name = input("Enter Your Name :")
student_roll = input("Enter roll no :")
if student_name=="Pratyush" and student_roll=="100":
   print("Hello Pratyush Welcome to Edyoda...")
   print("Hope Everything is going well...")
print("Hello Student How are You")

if-else Statements  ==> If we are having Two Conditions:
===================

Syntax:
    
if condition:
    Statement-1
    Statement-2 

else:
   Statement-3 
   Statement-4 

Whatever condition we have given in if block is True then only if block will be executed 
else else will part will be executed.

Only one block will be executed in case of if and else.


#if elif and else Statement: --> Multiple Condition
======================================================

Syntax:

if condition:
    statement-1
    statement-2 

elif condition:
    statement-3
    statement-4

elif condition:
    statement-5
    statement-6

elif condition:
    statement-7
    statement-8

else:
    statement-9
    statement-10


In case if elif and else bloch whereever the Condition is True that block will be executed
and In case of if elif and else block only one block will be executed.


#Example of if elif and else

day = int(input("Enter Month Day :")) #5 --> May --> 7 --> July  8 --> August,12 --> December
if day==1:
    print("Januray Month it is ")
elif day==2:
    print("February Month it is")
elif day==3:
    print("March Month it is")
elif day==4:
    print("April Month it is")
elif day==5:
    print("May Month it is")
elif day==6:
    print("June Month it is")
elif day==7:
    print("July Month it is")
elif day==8:
    print("August Month it is")
elif day==9:
    print("September Month it is")
elif day==10:
    print("October Month it is")
elif day==11:
    print("November Month it is")
elif day==12:
    print("December Month it is")
else:
    print("Please Enter Valid Input")


Nested if elif and else: Condition inside condition is known as Nested Conditional Statement.
========================

Syntax:

if condition:
    if condition:
        if condtion:
          statement-1 

        else:
            statement-2
    else:
        statement-3
else:
    statement-4


#Example of Nested if elif and else Statement:
print("Enter D For Days and M for Month")
Choice = input("Enter Your Choice :") #X
if Choice=="M":
    month = int(input("Enter Month :"))
    if month==1:
        print("Januray Month it is ")
    elif month==2:
        print("February Month it is")
    elif month==3:
        print("March Month it is")
    elif month==4:
        print("April Month it is")
    elif month==5:
        print("May Month it is")
    elif month==6:
        print("June Month it is")
    elif month==7:
        print("July Month it is")
    elif month==8:
        print("August Month it is")
    elif month==9:
        print("September Month it is")
    elif month==10:
        print("October Month it is")
    elif month==11:
        print("November Month it is")
    elif month==12:
        print("December Month it is")
    else:
        print("Please Enter Valid Input")


elif Choice=='D':
    day = int(input("Enter Day :")) #15
    if day==1:
        print("Monday it is")
    elif day==2:
        print("Tuesday it is")
    elif day==3:
        print("Wednesday it is")
    elif day==4:
        print("Thursday it is")
    elif day==5:
        print("Friday it is")
    elif day==6:
        print("Saturday it is")
    elif day==7:
        print("Sunday it is")
    else:
        print("Please Enter Valid Day")
else:
    print("Please enter Either M or D as they are Valid inputs")
